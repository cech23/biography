        </h4>

She was also a great conversationalist and&nbsp;was always looking for avenues to enhance her life. This quest coupled with her outgoing nature eventually made her rediscover her culinary skills. &nbsp;Ann eventually became a caterer as she kept receiving orders to provide friends and clients some of her delicious dishes at events such as engagements, weddings, parties and other social events, to the admiration of those who engaged her services.

        </h3>
        <p class="u-align-center u-text u-text-2"><i>God looked around His garden and found an empty&nbsp;place.&nbsp;</i><i></i><i>He looked down upon the&nbsp;earth and saw&nbsp;someone&nbsp;He truly loves. He put his arms around you and lifted you to rest, but you did not go alone for part of us went with you!</i><i></i>
          <br>
          <br>&nbsp;We still can’t fathom why the almighty chose to call you so early away from us. We have still not recovered from the shock, which the news of your sudden death sent our spines. We are hanging on to the Serenity prayer which says “God, give us the strength to accept what cannot be changed, the courage to change that which could be change and the wisdom to know the difference”.&nbsp;Ann, we wish you were still here with us to enjoy&nbsp;life, the plan to get you your own restaurant, but God loves you more and wants you by His side.&nbsp;&nbsp;We remember, with nostalgia, as children games we played together, laughter we had&nbsp;together, songs we sang together, fights we had&nbsp;and&nbsp;yet&nbsp;remained&nbsp;brothers and sisters.&nbsp;&nbsp;You played&nbsp;a motherly role after&nbsp;the demise of our dear mother, taking care of Akofa, a role you played with lots of love and care until your untimely departure.&nbsp;All the&nbsp;memories we shared, the secrets&nbsp;we shared, we grew up to find we have a love&nbsp;for each&nbsp;other that&nbsp;is very special and very strong. &nbsp;You are our sister not by choice but by nature of our birth. We could not have chosen a much better sister; you are the best on earth, and this is true!&nbsp;&nbsp;Life indeed, as the&nbsp;old adage&nbsp;says, is full of&nbsp;uncertainties; today you&nbsp;are&nbsp;here, tomorrow you are gone. The mortality&nbsp;of men is&nbsp;a&nbsp;certainty, which&nbsp;as humans we tend to lose&nbsp;sight of until we are&nbsp;called one&nbsp;day to be with&nbsp;our maker. &nbsp;Ann Antwi,&nbsp;da yie. Demerifa due. &nbsp;You will be missed&nbsp; by all. We know you are in the&nbsp;bossom&nbsp;of the&nbsp;lord. &nbsp;Rest&nbsp;in peace!

        <p class="u-align-center u-text u-text-3"> A mother's love is a light to every child's soul and to have a Godly caring mother is a blessing.&nbsp;Mama Akua, on that black Wednesday morning when preparing for vacation classes I told Dady that grandma died early at the age of 67 that grandma should have waited for me to grow to take care of her,&nbsp;little did I know that you will soo soon depart at such young age. I called you that black Wednesday morning to check on you, you told me you were not feeling well which I advised you go to hospital, again little did I know that was going to be the last time I will hear or see you &nbsp;My mother was lovely and caring that every child would have loved to have as mother, she gave me life, fed me, clothed me, thought me &nbsp;shouted at me when the need arose. An inspirational mother who always advice’s &nbsp;me to be respectful to all manner of persons, take my education serious as that will be my perfect future picture and not to depart from my creator.&nbsp;I asked myself what will life be to me in this wicked world without a mother, but I take comfort that ‘’it is appointed unto man to die and after death judgment” (Hebrews 9:27), comfort that I have I have Auntie Maggie, Dady Ohene's wife, my lovely Aunties, lovely Mothers and other love ones &nbsp;Mama Akua, I love you, let your spirit continue to watch over me and protect me till we meet again &nbsp;Rest Well, Rest Well, Rest Well &nbsp;</p>
